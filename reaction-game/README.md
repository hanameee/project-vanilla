# The reaction game

## How this game works ðŸ‘¾

The reaction game works as follows:

1. Player clicks a button. 
2. Color of the clicked button changes in order to signify hat the game has begun.
3. After a random amount of time (max: 10sec), color of the button is changed once more.
4. The user must click the input again as fast as they can.
5. User that records a fastest reaction time wins!


## What you'll need to build this game  ðŸ”¨

1. You'll need 3 state of button. (start, in progress, press now)
2. You'll need to generate random amout of time to wait for each round.
3. You'll need to record time for each round.
4. You'll also need reset logic to restart the game.
